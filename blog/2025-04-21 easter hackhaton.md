# 2025-04-21 easter hackhaton

There’s something incredibly soothing for me when the holidays come to an end and that period is finally over. The curtain falls, and with it drops all the pressure around “doing something” with the holiday time. As someone who’s been dissociating their whole life, I actually much prefer weekdays full of work—structured days where I can function, where I have focus. That is, if I manage to carve out any free time at all.

Holidays are tough for me because I feel overwhelmed and torn between the obligation to spend them with family and friends, and the desire to spend them on myself. And if it’s for myself, there’s a queue of abandoned tasks and projects waiting—cleaning, washing the car, sports, and rest. That rest… ideally, I’d lie down for a few days straight and, with growing dread, realize I don’t know who I am, where I come from, or where I’m going.

Since we have less and less time, for years I’ve felt a constant weltschmerz, the scent of The Cinnamon Shops, and the zeitgeist of incoming AI assistants. Excited by Zettelkasten note-taking, I tried to give it a shot. After all, why not?

So I entered into an intense romance with ChatGPT and Copilot, sleeping just a few hours a night, going to bed between 6 and 8 a.m. And what’s the result of my hackathon?

Driven by compulsion and ADHD, I started multiple project repositories: a Static Site Generator using native GitHub Actions, an extended version using HTML chunks and config files, a concept of building the same thing but without an app—working directly from a regular desktop file browser supported by bash scripts. I brainstormed my own system inspired by Humane Interfaces / MEMEX / Zettelkasten. I ran out of space in ChatGPT voice chats, so I came up with a way to package what ChatGPT writes—so I could transfer it between chats—using a meta-natural language that compresses natural language using Chinese and emoji. I created a manifesto for a framework for working with AI on design patterns.

And how can you neatly sum this up?

Jef Raskin, the creator of the Macintosh—whose Canon Cat computer, by the way, was a revolutionary product in the spirit of Engelbart but never caught on—[said in an interview](https://youtu.be/1qvrOEExlps?si=nKUcyid0AOUpN06-&t=391):
“Computer interfaces were never good. I stopped working on them because today I already have all the tools I originally dreamed of building.”

> The perfect tool is the one you stop using once it has served its purpose.
